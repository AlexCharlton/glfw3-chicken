# CHICKEN GLFW3 Bindings

## Description
Bindings to the [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) OpenGL window and event management library, version 3.X.

## Requirements
Bind

## Documentation
Direct bindings generated by [bind](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/bind). Names Scheme-ified, with GLFW prefixes removed. Constants surrounded by `+`s (e.g. `+alpha-bits+`)

Version 3 of GLFW is not backwards compatible with previous major versions of GLFW.

For information regarding the GLFW API, see the official [GLFW documentation](http://www.glfw.org/documentation.html).

### High-level interface

#### make-window
    (make-window WIDTH HEIGHT NAME
	             #!key (fullscreen? #f)
				 resizable
				 visible
				 decorated
				 red-bits green-bits blue-bits alpha-bits
				 depth-bits stencil-bits
				 accum-red-bits accum-green-bits accum-blue-bits accum-alpha-bits
				 aux-buffers
				 samples
				 refresh-rate
				 sterio
				 srgb-capable
				 client-api
				 context-version-major
				 context-version-minor
				 context-robustness
				 opengl-forward-compat
				 opengl-debug-context
				 opengl-profile)

Create the window with title string NAME and dimensions WIDTH by HEIGHT. The keys correspond to the available [GLFW window hints](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html#window_hints). `resizable`, `visible`, `decorated`, `sterio`, `srgb-capable`, `opengl-forward-compat`, `opengl-debug-context` accept boolean arguments, while all other accept either an integer or an appropriate GLFW constant as per the documentation.

#### *window*
This variable contains the GLFW window object that is created by `make-window`.

#### with-window
    [macro] (with-window (WIDTH HEIGHT NAME . KEYS) BODY ...)

Initializes GLFW, creates a window as per `make-window`, and runs BODY before cleaning up. If [opengl-glew](https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/opengl-glew) has been included in the same file that this macro is used, opengl-glew will also be initialized.


## Example
This example must be compiled due to the external function definition.

``` Scheme
(import foreign)
(use (prefix glfw3 glfw:))

(define-external (keyCallback (c-pointer window)
                              (int key) (int scancode) (int action) (int mods))
    void
  (cond
   [(and (eq? key glfw:+key-escape+) (eq? action glfw:+press+))
    (glfw:set-window-should-close *window* #t)]))

(glfw:with-window (640 480 "Example" resizable: #f)
    (glfw:set-key-callback glfw:*window* #$keyCallback)
    (let loop ()
      (glfw:swap-buffers glfw:*window*)
      (glfw:poll-events)
      (unless (glfw:window-should-close glfw:*window*)
        (loop))))
```
